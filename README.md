Team project for Consulting based on stata.
The purpose of this project is to study whether remodeling is a significant factor in determining property prices, and if it is significant, is remodeling increasing or decreasing property prices? And in what magnitude does remodeling change property prices.
This report uses multivariate regression analysis and hedonic pricing theory to analyze remodeling effects. More specifically, by regressing logarithm of property prices on such independent variables as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, year built, whether being remodeled, whether being remodeled in the past ten years, year built, etc., we are able to find out the exact relation between remodeling and home prices.
